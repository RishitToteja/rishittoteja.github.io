  abstract={Skin diseases are among the most prevalent medical conditions globally. Detecting these diseases requires a high degree of expertise and precision from dermatologists, making computer-aided diagnosis highly beneficial. In this paper, we present an approach for detecting skin diseases that provides enhanced diagnostic insights. Several studies have been conducted to aid in the diagnosis of skin conditions, including skin cancer and tumors. However, accurate identification remains a challenge due to factors such as the visual similarity between different conditions, low contrast between lesions and surrounding skin, and the subtle differences between affected and unaffected regions. Our approach employs an image dataset that is pre-processed through deblurring, noise reduction, and enhancement techniques. Following pre-processing, the images are segmented using the U-Net architecture, and MobileNetV2 is employed for classification. The disease is detected based on distinct patterns observed in the processed images, corresponding to the dispersant characteristics of each condition. Additionally, we compute a class saliency map for each input image and its associated class. This work demonstrates how Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) can be used effectively for both the classification and segmentation of skin diseases, utilizing saliency maps to improve interpretability.}
